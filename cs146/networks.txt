What is a network?
    Connecting computers to share information
        A physical connection via wires, cables, wireless media, etc
        A logical connection through transport of information across the physical media
    Several rules:
        There must be a sender and reciever
        There must be a payload (Why send an empty packet?)
        Machines must use the same communicaions protocol
        Data must be delivered without corruption
        Something has to check that data is uncorrupted and return an error if it is
        Something has to know origin and destination of the info
    Why build a network?
        Faster communications
        Encourages standard policies and procedures
        Backup/recovery support
        Easy to store copies of dataShared resources lower costs
    What is a hub?
        Anything coming in is sent out on every port
        Everything is broadcasted everywhere
    What is a switch?
        Does what a hub does, but learns where addresses are to be more efficient - then it only sends to the correct address
    What is a router?
        Smart and complicated
        Two addresses - one for LAN(Local Area Network), one for WAN(wide area network)
    What else can a router do?
        DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - assigns dynamic IP addresses
        NAT(Network Address Translation) - translates local IP address of packets to internet IP adress and vice-versa
    What is a bridge?
        A network device that connects multiple network segments
        In the OSI model bridging acts in the first two layers
    What is a protocol?
        Agreement on how to communicate
        Common internet protocols: TCP/IP, HHTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, etc
