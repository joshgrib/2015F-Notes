Interfaces
    A class that implements the interface provides code for the ADT
    Interface is the stuff, implementation is how it works
    The interface definition shows only headings for it's methods
        Because only headings are shown, these methods are called abstract methods
        Each abstract method *must* be defined in a class that implements the interface
